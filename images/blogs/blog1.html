                <h3>My Journey To Becoming a Web Developer</h3>  
                <h4>July 19, 2020</h4>   
                <img src="learn-code.jpg">                    
                
                <p>Since my family migrated to Aruba, I have worked as a freelance musician. In the past few years it has been my bread and butter. It has given me the chance to earn money from something I enjoy doing while fulfilling my duties as a wife and mother. </p>
                <p>Before the end of 2019, I decided to learn a new skill that can offer as much flexibility and can provide the means for financial stability. Hence, I started learning Web Development.</p>
                <p>Like anything else, starting has been the most challenging. I’ve done endless research of courses to take. I started with the basics, the foundation of web development:  HTML, CSS, Javascript. And then later on, proceeded with learning the back-end side: React, Redux, JSX, database administration, hosting environments, version control, and accessibility and security compliance.</p>
                <p>I managed to set two to three hours of learning to code in between gigs and home duties. This journey has not been a straight line, it was not easy. But the real challenge was when in the middle of it, the Covid-19 pandemic happened. In my head, it wasn’t only about time management and juggling three jobs in a day. This time, I have to deal with stress and anxiety too. My husband and I worked in tourism and we both lost our source of income. The real challenge this time was to keep myself together in order to continue learning and to finally use what I’ve learned to get a job.</p>
                <p>Here are the things I did to stay focused in the middle of a chaotic environment.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <h4>1.&nbsp;Start The Day Early</h4>
                        <p>I start my day with prayer/meditation so waking-up between 4am to 5am works for me. I get more things done when I start at early hours because I can work without being interrupted. Less distractions. You can set your own time, whatever works for you. The key is to create and preserve a space so you can focus on your work.</p>

                        <h4>2.&nbsp;Create Goals and Work on it Diligently</h4>
                        <p>Create a TO-DO list. Write down the things you intend to finish in a day or week, whether to work on a project or learn a section of a course. When you work at home, it is easy to get distracted and lose focus. Sometimes you get side-tracked and work on something else or do an errand. The list can help you get back on track. At the end of the day, you get to see how much more you need to work on and how much you have accomplished.</p>

                        <h4>3.&nbsp;Take One-Task-At-A-Time</h4>
                        <p>I remember when I was researching on how to get started with Web Development. I got overwhelmed of how much information and skills I have to learn. My body froze and my mind felt paralyzed. The goal of being a full-stack web developer felt impossible. Until I divided it into small portions. Learn by section until you finish the whole course. It is important to feel content with your small accomplishments to avoid burn-out.</p>                        

                        <h4>4.&nbsp;Prepare to Make Adjustments</h4>
                        <p>Every now and then you will encounter bumps along the way. Expect to fail. You may miss deadlines. You may have spent more time finishing a topic/course than expected. That’s alright. Nobody’s perfect.  Make necessary adjustments and move on.</p>
                        
                        <h4>5.&nbsp;Get Enough Rest. Sleep.</h4>
                        <p>While the end goal of being a Web Developer is important, it is equally important that you take enough sleep. Take breaks and rest. It’s important to keep yourself healthy. Having enough rest makes your brain function better which results to better learning and better work productivity. </p>        
                    </div>
                <p>As of today, I am a certified front-end developer. I can convert web designs into websites that users can interact with. I am also a back-end web developer in trainee. I am in the process of mastering the server-side of web development. My journey is far from over but I must also acknowledge the fact that I have come a long way and learned so much. I am only halfway through becoming a full-stack web developer. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I am excited to discover the things that I can do. I am looking forward to unfold the possibilities this journey will take me. </p>
