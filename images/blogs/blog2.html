                <h3>Becoming a Web Developer in your 40s</h3>  
                <h4>July 20, 2020</h4>   
                <img src="planning.jpg">                    
                
                <p>For the past few years, I have worked as a freelance singer-musician. It has been my bread and butter. It has given me the chance to earn money from something I enjoy while fulfilling my duties as a wife and mother.</p>
                <p>Before the end of 2019, my family’s financial situation took a down turn when my husband lost his job. That’s when I realized I needed to step-up and decided to learn another skill for me to find a job that will provide the same flexibility but better financial stability and personal growth. Hence I started learning Web Development. I knew then it was not going to be an easy journey. And taking into account that I’m almost 40, adds on to the challenge. But I did not concede, rather I faced my fears and the uncertainty.</p>
                <p>Here are the things to keep in mind when you make the career shift.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <h4>1.&nbsp;It’s Never Too Late to Start Something New</h4>
                        <p>Showing your interest to start a new skill in itself is already an advantage. It shows that you want to improve yourself. Rather than being stagnant in life, you are brave enough to take that step to make a change and move forward. </p>

                        <h4>2.&nbsp;It is not going to be easy BUT it is possible</h4>
                        <p>You have to be prepared to put in the work. Work consistently and diligently.  When things get tough (and it will, more times than you expect), you have to push through. Persist. Keep going. It is easier said than done but one thing that helped me pushed through is imagining myself a year after. If I start now, I’ll be a year older with a new skill. If I don’t, I’ll just be a year older.</p>

                        <h4>3.&nbsp;Practice Makes Perfect</h4>
                        <p>Sure you can follow through the course tutorials. But the real test to understanding is when you start building on your own. You will grasp and remember the concept and foundation better if you apply them on your own projects. And then you can present these as your job experiences.</p>

                        <h4>4.&nbsp;Use your previous career/skills to your advantage.</h4>
                        <p>Realize that you are not actually starting from zero. At this age, you have already gained a lot of experiences both in life and in your past career. Incorporate them in your new found skill. It can be as simple as having people skills, research, and/or adaptability. You might be surprised of how much these seemingly simple traits can help boost your new career.</p>
                        
                        <h4>5.&nbsp;Never Stop Learning. </h4>
                        <p>Web Development is extensive and dynamic. There is always something new. Be prepared to learn new information from time to time.</p>        
                    </div>
                <p>In the end, you are the only one who can set your own limitations. You are the only one who can stop you. Don’t let age define you. Once you succeed in attaining your goal, you’ll be glad you did it.</p>
